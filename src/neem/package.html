 <p> The usage of the NeEM protocol is explained here by depicting the process of building a simple chat application. This application grabs text from console, and sends it to the group. In the command line used to start it, one must pass the local port where it will bind at, and also of, at least a peer address.</p>

Step by step:
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first step is to create an instance of the NeEMChannel:</p>
<pre>
NeEMChannel neem = new NeEMChannel(new InetSocketAddress(port));
</pre>
</li>
<LI>
 <p>After the channel is created, peers are added to connect to the overlay
 network:</p>
<pre>
	for(...)
		neem.connect(new InetSocketAddress(...));
</pre>
 <p>Any number of peers can be connected. The channel will keep only
 the appropriate number of active connections. A single peer is sufficient
 to boot, as the dynamic membership protocol will grow the number of local
 peers. Peers can be added at any time, for instance, to merge two partitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
 <p> Our chat application must then start a thread to poll for incoming messages using the channel interface using the following code:<p>
<pre>
    public void run() {
        try {
            while(true) {
        		byte[] buf = new byte[1000];
                ByteBuffer bb=ByteBuffer.wrap(buf);
                neem.read(bb);
        		System.out.println(new String(buf));
            }
        } catch(Exception e) {e.printStackTrace();}
    }
</pre>
</LI>
<LI>
 <p> Finally, grab each text line from the console, encapsulate it in a ByteBuffer and use the write method to spread the message to the group:</p>
<pre>
            BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            String line;

            while ((line = r.readLine()) != null) {
                neem.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(line.getBytes()));
            }

            neem.close();
</pre>
</LI>
</ul>
</body>
