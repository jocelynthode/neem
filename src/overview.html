<!--<h2>NeEM - Network-friendly Epidemic Multicast protocol</h2> -->

<p>The protocol described in these pages, enables a set of Java(R) aplications to group comunicate using an epidemic multicast protocol, wich's goal is to provide reliable comuniaction over an unreliable channel, while decreasing bandwith usage.</p>
<p>The epidemic multicast concept means that a message destined to every member of a group is NOT, in fact, sent to every member of that group. Instead, it is sent to a minority of members. Each member that receives the message for the first time, delivers it and relays it to others. If the same message is received a second time, it's discarded. This is beeing done by adding an unique identifier to each message.</p>
<p>This behaviour is achieved by, at each member, maintaing a dynamic local membership, wich is to say that this membership is constantly changing through time. This reduces the impact of joins and departures of members to/from the group. When a message is to be sent, it is sent to a few members of the sender's local membership. These relay the message to a few members of their local group and so on, until everyone has received the message.</p>
