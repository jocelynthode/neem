	<p>The NeEM library provides an implementation of epidemic multicast (also called 
	probabilistic or gossip-based) in wide-area networks by using 
	multiple TCP/IP connections in a non-blocking fashion.</p>

	<p>Epidemic multicast protocols achieve stable high throughput
	regardless of node and network faults and scale to very large numbers
	of participants.
	The resulting protocol can be used for event dissemination to
	a very large number of interested parties.</p>

	<p>Implementation is based on Java5 and takes advantage
	of the NIO interfaces to maintain multiple network connections without
	excessive threading overhead. The goal of this implementation is to be
	small, self-contained, and practical.</p>
 
 <p>This text will (hopefuly) describe the steps to take, in order to design an 
aplication that resorts to the NEEM protocol for group comunication.</p>


<h2>How to start?</h2>

<ol>
<li>
First of all, such application MUST conform with the App interface,  thereby 
  implementing every method of this class.
  </li>

<li>
 The implementation of the methods in the App interface is free. As long as 
 the methods of the underlying classes are used correctly, the application WILL
 work as expected.
</li>

<li>
 Two synchronization ports must be defined. One where messages related with 
 membership can be relayed between group members (m_syncport). The other port
 is used to relay messages sent from the application layer (g_syncport). The 
 transport layer supports more than one gossip, to provide support for several
 applications sending messages to the same group, while sharing the transport 
 layer, and it's connections. Such support, led to where every message that is
 sent to the group must state wich port it's intended for. If this stated port
 equals m_syncport, then it's delivered to the MembershipImpl class instance
 associated with each Transport class instance. If it's not, it'll have to be
 delivered to the GossipImpl class instance. As at the transport level there's 
 a Map of Gossips indexed by port, an atempt is made to deliver the message to 
 the GossipImpl instance at the port the message states. If a Gossip exists at
 that index, the message is delivered to it, if not it's dropped.
  At the Gossip and Membership layer, for each message message to be sent, an 
 unique identifier is generated using the UUID class. This unique identifier is 
 stored in a HashSet class instance. If the incoming message has already been
 received by either layer, i.e., its identifier is present in the HashSet, the
 message is dropped silently.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is needed to run?</h2>

<p>
 As soon as the application has implemented the methods of the App interface,
 it's time to begin piling up the layers. The application WILL require 1 (one),
 or more, instance(s) of the GossipImpl class ( for multicast and receive),
 1 (one) instance of the MembershipImpl class ( to deal with local group 
 membership changes) and one instance of the Transport class ( wich provides
 comunication primitives to both previously refered classes, and is shared 
 between them).
 </p><p>
  To create an instance of the Transport class, the constructor of the class
 has to be called with 2 (two) arguments: the ip address and the port to bind
 at.
</p>
<p>
  To instanciate the Gossip class, 4 (four) parameters MUST be supplied:
 the Transport class instance that provides comunication, the port thas is used
 by the transport class to deliver received gossip related messages, the fanout
 wich is the maximum number of local group members to adress each message and
 the group size, or, more accurately, the maximum local group size.
  Similar to the process to create a Gossip object, the creation of a Membership
 object takes 4 (four) parameters: the Transport class instance that provides 
 comunication, the port thas is used by the transport class to deliver received
 membership related messages, the fanout wich is the maximum number of local
 group members to adress each message and the group size, or, more accurately, the
 maximum local group size.
