NeEM: Network-friendly Epidemic Multicast

1. Overview
-----------

The NeEM library provides an implementation of epidemic multicast
(also called probabilistic or gossip-based) in wide-area networks by
using multiple TCP/IP connections in a non-blocking fashion. The
resulting overlay network is automatically managed by the protocol.

Epidemic multicast protocols achieve stable high throughput regardless
of node and network faults and scale to very large numbers of
participants. The resulting protocol can be used for event
dissemination to a very large number of interested parties.

Implementation is based on Java and takes advantage of the NIO
interfaces to maintain multiple network connections without threading
overhead. The goal of this implementation is to be small,
self-contained, and practical.

2. Demos and Tools
------------------

This package contains demonstration applications for the NeEM protocol.
Currently:

 - net.sf.neem.apps.Chat - simple console-based interactive chat application

 - net.sf.neem.apps.Glue - glue multiple groups together

 - net.sf.neem.apps.jmx.Reconfig - change protocol configuration of multiple
 running peers using JMX

 - net.sf.neem.apps.jmx.DumpGraph - dumps current overlay network as a Graphviz
 .dot file

 - net.sf.neem.apps.perf.Crowd - launches a batch of silent peers

 - net.sf.neem.apps.perf.Source - injects traffic in a group

 - net.sf.neem.apps.perf.Drain - logs traffic received from a group

To test remote access with JMX, as required by net.sf.neem.apps.jmx.*, use the 
following VM options:

 java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=someport \
	-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
	-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false net.sf.neem.apps.Chat ...

where "someport" is an available TCP/IP port for listening.
Then run apps.jmx.* as follows:

 java net.sf.neem.apps.jmx.DumpGraph hostname:someport
 java net.sf.neem.apps.jmx.Reconfig data/default.properties hostname.someport

WARNING: This configuration disables access control! For a production
environment disable JMX remote access or check JMX documentation to
learn how to setup secure access control.
