NeEM: Network-friendly Epidemic Multicast

1. Overview
-----------

The NeEM library provides an implementation of epidemic multicast
(also called probabilistic or gossip-based) in wide-area networks by
using multiple TCP/IP connections in a non-blocking fashion. The
resulting overlay network is automatically managed by the protocol.

Epidemic multicast protocols achieve stable high throughput regardless
of node and network faults and scale to very large numbers of
participants. The resulting protocol can be used for event
dissemination to a very large number of interested parties.

Implementation is based on Java5 and takes advantage of the NIO
interfaces to maintain multiple network connections without threading
overhead. The goal of this implementation is to be small,
self-contained, and practical.
